# VenueCardsScreen.js (Previously VenueCards.js)


## Description
Previously known as 'VenueCards.js', this component is a screen that displays venue cards,
which includes an image, venue name, and venue neighborhood. Scrolling is vertical.
It grabs data from a GraphQL database and use Apollo to connect the two entities. The query
to grab over 60 venues worth of data includes venue id, venue name, venue description,
venue hoursText, neighborhood names, photo handles (part of a compressed image's url),
and category name.


## Properties
Contains props passed from react-navigation and apollo's GraphQL query:
<PropsTable of={VenueCardsScreen} />


## Requirements
Follow these steps to set up the environment (using the terminal):
- Install NVM (Node Version Manager) `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`

- Run `nvm install node` to install the latest version of node.

- You must have the expo-cli to run this project. So run the command `npm install -g expo-cli`

- Now, if you want to run an iphone emulator, an easy way to download it is to download XCode if you have a Mac.
If you want to run on an android emulator, the process is a bit longer but you'll just have to download Android Studio
and download an emulator from within there. If you choose to run and test on your mobile device, install the Expo app
from your Google play store or Apple App store.


## How to run
Create a folder to clone this repo to and cd into it. Run these commands on your terminal:

- `git clone "https://github.com/pcooney10/rn-starter-edgar"`

- `cd rn-starter-edgar`

- `expo start`

- Now, depending on the emulator you want to to use, in the terminal press 1 of 3 options:

1. `i` to run on an iphone emulator you've installed on your PC

2. `a` if you have an android emulator installed on your PC

3. `e` to send a link to your phone via email or text.


## Basic Usage
Connect with GraphQL via Apollo and querie data that will be passed into this
component. Component is looking for venue.id, venue.name, venue.neighborhood.name, and
a venue.photos[0].handle. The handle is then put at the end of a url string to
display an image.

This component passes its query down to the child component VenueDetailsScreen.js with
the help of React Navigation. Due to this, child component will be expecting
venue.address, venue.description, venue.hoursText, and venue.category.name so be
sure to query that as well.


## UI
On a web browser, this will appear as a long list of venue cards. On a mobile
application, this component will have as many cards that could fit in a phone screen,
typically 4 at least, and the user will have to scroll down to view the rest of the list.

  {() => {
    // Apollo client setup
    const client = new ApolloClient({
      uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/paperhorn-gull-359'
    });

    // StyleSheet
    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: 'center',
        backgroundColor: colors.primary2,
        marginLeft: 111,
        marginRight: 276,
      }
    });

    return (
      <ApolloProvider client={client}>
        <View style={styles.container}>
          <VenueCardsScreen />
        </View>
      </ApolloProvider>
    );
  }}
